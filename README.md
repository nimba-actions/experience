# Experience

This project automates the setup and deployment of a Salesforce Digital Experience (formerly known as Community).

## What This Does

1. **Creates a Digital Experience Site**: 
   - Sets up a new Digital Experience site in your Salesforce org.
   - Uses a predefined template (defaults to "Customer Service").
   - Customizes the site name and URL prefix.

2. **Configures User Access**:
   - Designates the default Scratch Org user as the "Community Owner".
   - Sets up a Community User.
   - Configures a Network Member Group record.

3. **Enhances User Interface**:
   - Adds a "Log in as User" button to the standard Contact layout, improving admin usability.

4. **Loads Sample Data**:
   - Populates the Experience with sample data, providing a realistic environment for testing or demonstration.

5. **Automates Deployment Process**:
   - Includes pre-deployment steps to set up the basic structure and configuration.
   - Performs post-deployment tasks to finalize the setup, including publishing the Experience site.

6. **Ensures Consistency Across Environments**:
   - Provides optional flows for configuring both development and managed package environments.
   - Uses environment variables to maintain consistency in naming and configuration across different orgs.

This configuration streamlines the process of setting up a fully functional Salesforce Digital Experience in Scratch, Sandbox, or Production environments.
